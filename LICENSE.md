# CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal

## Preamble

Through this CERN Open Hardware Licence version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S) the Licensor grants permission to You to Use the Licensed Material, and gives You the freedom to modify and share it within the terms of this Licence.

The CERN-OHL-S is a “strong reciprocal” licence, which means that You may distribute Your modifications or derivatives of the Licensed Material (including as part of a Larger Work) only under the same licence, or a similar licence if permitted under section 4.3.

If You distribute or convey the Licensed Material (or any modifications or derivatives thereof), You must ensure that every recipient is provided with a copy of this Licence and reference to its location, and that all notices are retained.

CERN initiated the CERN Open Hardware Licence to provide a framework for collaborative hardware development, aiming to maximise the impact of its research and development activities. This Licence shares the same principles as free and open source software licences, applying them to hardware designs and products. It is designed to be a legally binding agreement that is clear, unambiguous, and easy to understand.

This Licence is intended to be applied to any 'Licensed Material', including hardware designs, circuit board layouts, mechanical drawings, flowcharts, descriptive documents, and software (such as firmware, drivers, or user-space applications).

This Preamble is not part of the Licence terms.

## 1. Definitions

1.1 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-S version 2.

1.2 'Licensed Material' means any Documentation, Design, or Product licensed under this Licence.

1.3 'Documentation' means schematic diagrams, designs, circuit board layouts, mechanical drawings, flowcharts, textual descriptions, explanatory material, and other descriptive material of any kind (including Product specifications, data sheets, instructions, manuals, and software source code) that is explicitly licensed under this Licence. Software source code explicitly licensed under this Licence is Documentation.

1.4 'Design' means Documentation in any tangible or intangible form that is not Products.

1.5 'Product' means any device, component, assembly, work, or physical object, whether in final or intermediate form, that is (i) manufactured from the Design, or (ii) is itself Documentation. Products may be directly manufactured or indirectly manufactured (e.g. using a 3D printer). Software in executable form (such as firmware or application code) is a Product.

1.6 'Licensor' means any person or entity that distributes Licensed Material under this Licence.

1.7 'You' means any person or entity exercising permissions granted by this Licence. 'Your' has a corresponding meaning.

1.8 'Use' means making, using, studying, modifying, improving, distributing, conveying, selling, offering for sale, importing, and otherwise exploiting any Licensed Material. 'Used' has a corresponding meaning.

1.9 'Modification' means any change to the Licensed Material, or any part of the Licensed Material.

1.10 'Derivative' means any work based on the Licensed Material or on the Licensed Material and other pre-existing works.

1.11 'Larger Work' means any work that combines the Licensed Material or portions thereof with material not governed by the terms of this Licence.

1.12 'Available' means that the Licensor provides access to the Complete Corresponding Source of the Licensed Material, in the manner specified in section 3.2.

1.13 'Complete Corresponding Source' means all Documentation, Design, and software source code required to study, modify, and manufacture Products based on the Licensed Material. This includes any scripts, test benches, simulation data, and other supporting material needed to generate the Licensed Material in its preferred form for modification. It does not include general-purpose tools, compilers, or operating systems provided by third parties, unless they are essential for this purpose and not readily available.

1.14 'Notice' means any copyright notice, licence text, licence location reference, disclaimer, or other notice included in or with the Licensed Material by the Licensor.

## 2. Grant of Licence

2.1 The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual licence to Use the Licensed Material, subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence.

2.2 You are granted the right to sublicense the Licensed Material, provided You comply with the terms of this Licence.

## 3. Conveying Licensed Material

3.1 If You convey Licensed Material, You must: (a) retain all Notices included by the Licensor; (b) provide a copy of this Licence and a reference to its location (e.g., a URL) to every recipient; and (c) clearly indicate any Modifications You have made to the Licensed Material.

3.2 If You convey Licensed Material, You must make the Complete Corresponding Source Available to the recipients in one of the following ways: (a) by accompanying it with the Complete Corresponding Source; (b) by providing a specific URL or link to a publicly accessible, no-charge repository where the Complete Corresponding Source is readily available for at least three years from the date of conveyance; or (c) by offering to provide the Complete Corresponding Source upon request, for a reasonable charge covering the cost of physical media and distribution, for at least three years from the date of conveyance.

3.3 You may convey Products You manufacture from the Design in any form, provided You comply with sections 3.1 and 3.2.

## 4. Conveying Modifications and Derivatives

4.1 You may modify the Licensed Material and create Derivatives based on it, provided You comply with the terms of this Licence.

4.2 You may convey Your Modifications or Derivatives (including as part of a Larger Work) provided You comply with section 3, and provided that You license them under this Licence.

4.3 Notwithstanding section 4.2, You may license Your Modifications or Derivatives under a Similar Licence, provided that: (a) the Similar Licence is listed on the CERN Open Hardware Licence website ([https://cern.ch/ohl](https://cern.ch/ohl)); and (b) You clearly indicate which licence applies to which part of the work. A 'Similar Licence' is a licence that CERN has determined to provide substantially the same rights and obligations as this Licence.

4.4 You must ensure that the Complete Corresponding Source of Your Modifications or Derivatives is Available to recipients.

## 5. Larger Works

5.1 You may create a Larger Work by combining the Licensed Material (or its Modifications or Derivatives) with other material, provided that the other material is clearly identifiable and governed by its own licence terms.

5.2 Conveying a Larger Work is permitted provided that the part governed by this Licence (or a Similar Licence) complies with the requirements of section 4.

## 6. No Warranty and Limitation of Liability

6.1 **THE LICENSED MATERIAL IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE'. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED MATERIAL WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR THAT ITS USE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED.**

6.2 **TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.**

## 7. Patent Non-Assertion

7.1 Each Licensor agrees not to assert any patent claims it may have that are necessarily infringed by the Licensed Material (in the form provided by the Licensor) against You or any subsequent recipient for Use of that Licensed Material. This is a personal covenant not to sue and does not constitute a patent licence.

7.2 This non-assertion covenant does not apply to: (a) any Modifications or Derivatives made by You; (b) combinations of the Licensed Material with other hardware or software (i.e., Larger Works); (c) any patent claims that are infringed only by the combination, and not by the Licensed Material alone.

## 8. Termination

8.1 This Licence terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms.

8.2 If this Licence terminates, You must cease all Use of the Licensed Material. However, licences granted by You to third parties prior to termination shall survive, provided they remain in compliance.

8.3 Sections 6 (No Warranty), 7 (Patent Non-Assertion), and 9 (General) survive termination of this Licence.

## 9. General

9.1 This Licence does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of the Licensor.

9.2 This Licence shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensor is based, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The application of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

9.3 If any provision of this Licence is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms.
