The study of Polydopamine as an FDM/FFF build plate adhesion promoter, in place of typical polymers such as PEI and PET.


Polydopamine (PDA) is a versatile, biocompatible polymer formed from the oxidative self-polymerization of dopamine or other catecholamines, inspired by mussels' adhesive proteins. It can be coated on virtually any surface to create a thin, conformal layer and is widely used in biomedicine for applications like drug delivery, functionalization of implants, and creating bio-adhesives due to its unique chemistry, biocompatibility, and adhesion properties.

Polydopamine is created through the self-polymerization of dopamine in a basic solution, which oxidizes and polymerizes to form a thin, dark-colored film or nanoparticles. It is highly adhesive and can coat a wide variety of materials, including metals, ceramics, and polymers, without any external templates or other assistance. This excellent adhesion is dhe to the resulting polymer being rich in functional groups, such as catechols, amines, and imines, which allow it to be easily modified or functionalized with other molecules or nanoparticle, such as Colloidal Silica.

Polydopamine is known to become less directly adhesive via the aforementioned functional groups after blue-laser graphitization, but in return gains a stark increase to scratch and wear resistance -perfect for a 3D printer build surface. As this process is tunable, one may decide to graphitize a thinner layer for more polymer adhesion, or graphitize more of the coating for a true 3D "Graphene-like" surface that may also improve mechanical adhesion or "gripping" of a 3D printed polymer part.
